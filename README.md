The aim is to create a game using Unity, in which player deletes drones(bats) that swarm in a cave.
The buttons are used to remove the drones from the simulation to 'save the cat'.

To run our project in unity, 
1. Download sir's Swarm-main code and open it in Unity
2. Replace the files in Assets folder with those in our newest Homework folders but keep the Behavior, BehaviorObjects in our assest untouched
3. Run the project in unity (If they ask to download anything like TextMexhPro/TMP, just download it)
